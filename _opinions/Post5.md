Jared Owen has made a really cool animation that breaks down the ISS; I decided to watch this
purely because it had a chapter on docking ports (thanks, YouTube) but I think it's a cool
thing to watch for anyone working on space station design {% sidenote 'sn-proj' "Hint: My project students." %}.

What I think this video does better than a Wiki article is that it gives an incredible breakdown of
the ISS and some of its key components (especially the chapter on docking mechanisms).
