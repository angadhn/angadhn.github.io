1. Graeber opines on [flying cars and technological stagnation](https://davidgraeber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012-Of-flying-cars-and-the-declining-rate-of-profit.pdf),
which is a good companion to my earlier post on [his debate with Thiel](https://www.angadhn.com/opinions/Post3/).

2. A friend also shared with me Varoufakis's post on
[Star Trek's model for a techno-optimist utopia](https://unherd.com/2025/01/why-the-left-needs-to-watch-star-trek/).

3. In additon, I am reading Eric Berger's [Liftoff](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Liftoff-Desperate-Early-Launched-SpaceX/dp/0008445621),
which grounds the reality of building SpaceX against these utopian visions.
