- In preparing my WiP piece, I have been reading Hansen's Spaceflight Revolution. This led me to find Berglund's [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3169725A/en) for the [Hexagon Space Station](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a4/81/3b/cbb51975e79b10/US3169725.pdf).
- I also skimmed these resoures while preparing for my Astera proposal:
  - [Certification Guidelines For Crewed Inflatable Softgoods Structures](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220011425)
  - [Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) Protection Overview](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20190001193/downloads/20190001193.pdf)
- This was just one I should read [Whipple Shiled and Sizing Equations](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19920010826/downloads/19920010826.pdf). This will help me better understand modular MMOD protection suggsted by Gordon.
