I started thinking about how docking might work with an inflatable station such as the Goodyear one that I
[discussed here](https://www.angadhn.com/large%20space%20stations/space%20exploration/space-inflatables-1/).
I have been trying to think about how spacecraft might dock to such a station and how crew might transfer
from one vehicle to the other. While I don't have an answer yet, I thought I would share some videos I watched
to ignite my mind. I found the following one by Destin Sandlin to be a nice intro to rendezvousing with the ISS:

The below video is a quick video showing the Space Shuttle (Atlantis) docking to the International Space Station.

The video below is similar to the one by Destin Sandlin in that it gives some insight into the orbital mechanics.
However, it gives a lot more insight into Soyuz's launch and its high-level structural design. The voice of the narrator
is a bit annoying, though.
