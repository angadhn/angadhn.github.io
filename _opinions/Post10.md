These were some quick thoughts I shared with a friend after reading
[Varoufakis' recent article on a Star Trek-inspired Utopia](https://unherd.com/2025/01/why-the-left-needs-to-watch-star-trek/).
This loosely links to my earlier post on "[Graeber and Thiel](https://www.angadhn.com/opinions/Post3/)".

Yanis' utopian view is one I agree with that we should aim to live in a future 
where “People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things.” But his 
reasoning that accumulation is followed by imperialism is weak. Why? Becuase his 
premise is that a post-scarcity utopia can be achieved through energy abundance
(which is really what Star Trek's "Replicators" are: machines that can make 
anything from green energy{%sidenote "Replicators" "I haven't watched Star Trek so I am using his description of them."%}).
The follow-on question, which he doesn't really address, is how can one get to this 
infinite energy future without a manufacturer of solar panels or some other
harnessing technology of permanent/renewable energy sources? Can we manufacture
anything without gathering (accumulating!) resources to manufacture these 
technologies capable of harnessing and then supplying this infinite energy?

Just because energy is itself freely available doesn’t mean that we can manufacture 
distribution technologies without resource accumulation, which inevitably requires 
capital and agency. Today, capital is a basis for enabling agency to create these energy
abundance technologies just as much as good will/intentions. This capital can
come from bureaucractic governments, which are slow, or private capital, which can 
be fast- both can be to a detriment{%sidenote "Bureaucracy" "Which is why we need
to seriously experiment with new ways to organise action."%}. Thus, I don’t see 
anyway out of accumulation. In fact, I see it as essential to our energy abundant 
future- a future where [energy is too cheap to meter](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/making-energy-too-cheap-to-meter/).The questions that then follow 
are what are our technology options{%sidenote "Technology" "which I will explore
in a future post."%} to achieve this abundance and then we can think 
about the politics of organised action.

Capital is new; the evolution of our trading behaviours are not. Varoufakis' position ignores
our roots as not just hunters, but gatherers, which enables trade/barter (i.e., much like I said about
capital enabling agency but also many other things). To me, it follow that if no one gathers,
then no one can _have_ and therefor no one share/trade/barter with another. In that vein,
if everyone gathers (the same stuff) then everyone _can have_ but again, no one need
share/trade/barter. But in reality effort and motivation are not equally distributed among a
population, which's why only some people gather some of the stuff which then creates
conditions for trading.

Both Graeber (whom I love as his wit reminds me of Christopher Hitchens) and
Yanis have lofty goals but do not present concrete 
ideas of getting there from where we currently are. And this, to me, is lazy. What
we need to do is to solve a
[motion planning problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning)
that generates a path using, as inputs, today's conditions and their utopian goal 
state. But they don’t do that- perhaps it is because they are incapable of 
thinking about things in that way or they disagree with it or purely because they 
are more comfortable with arm-chair philosophising, which is frustrating. 
Moralistic posturing of this kind without action is hard to get behind because
it exposes a lack of appreciation of, especially today,
[technology being upstream of politics](https://x.com/BalajiAnthology/status/1599794788974428161#:~:text=Technology%20is%20the%20driving%20force%20of%20history.%20%0A%0AIt%20lies%20upstream%20of%20culture%2C%20and%20thus%20upstream%20of%20politics.)
and not the other way around. One only needs to look at the recent use of social 
media in elections across the world to understand this claim's veracity. One can
counterargue that Apollo is an example of politics bucking the claim but one only
needs to look at the idea's origin: Tsiolkovsky articulated the need for liquid
propelants, which inspired research into rocket propulsion
(largely in Germany and America) that was then weaponised and eventually became the
basis for the Apollo
program{%sidenote "Ignition" "Worth reading the first chapter of John Drury Clark's [_Ignition_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ignition-Informal-Propellants-University-Classics/dp/0813595835)."%}.
The political choices of weaponisation and space exploration
was thus downstream of rocket technology progress.

So, reader, I leave you with questions: do we really need another critique on 
today's world without a semblance of a solution? How long can we run on the fumes 
of a vision of what a wonderful world it could be?
