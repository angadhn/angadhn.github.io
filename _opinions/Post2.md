I have [previously written](https://www.angadhn.com/large%20space%20stations/space%20exploration/space-inflatables-1/) about inflatable tubes as a
means to realise a von Braun wheel. The idea of using inflatabes isn't particularly new, but Saul Griffith's robotics work was also fun to learn about
when I started thinking about using inflatables fort space applications over
the summer of 2024. Here are two interesting pieces of media on inflatlabes from
Saul Griffith.

The first is a Wired piece on him and [Otherlab](https://www.wired.com/2012/11/saul-griffith/#) and the second is the below video.
