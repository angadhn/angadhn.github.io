I am a big fan of Obsidian- it is my note-taking tool of choice but
my use has reduced since I started maintaining this blog. Nonetheless,
I still host my notes via Obsidian Publish; my goal is to actually combine
those notes with the bells and whistles of Tufte that this site has. So
that migration will begin at some point in the future. Why? Because,
I actually quite like Obsidian as an editor for writing; however,
the emergence of Cursor has made me use it lesser and lesser.
Nonetheless, I want to revisit the idea of being able to easily publish
my Obsidian notes with low friction [like Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/vault).
