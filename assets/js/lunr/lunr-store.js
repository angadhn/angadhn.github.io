        "excerpt":"⊕ Logo for SpaceHQ. We like to think of ourseleves as a ragtag group of outliers trying to figure out how we can build larger structures in space. An example challenge is how we can go from  modular stations such as ISS, as seen on the left of our logo, to rotating wheel space stations, on the right of our logo.   Who this page serves?  This is likely only useful for  QMUL’s final year undergraduate students in who are taking EMS690U final year project under my supervision. It will make little to no sense for anyone else (inlcuding those from QMUL) as there will be a lot covered in the in-person workshops. This is merely to augment to that; it is not meant as a standalone piece.   Project Areas  The core thesis of the project is that large (or even ultra-large) space structures could help us inspirational or useful things. Human habitation and space-based astronomy are classic examples of the former whereas  former whereas in-space manufacturing or tackling overcome existential risks/threats  In-Space Manufacturing (e.g., Organs, Electronics, and Pharmaceuticals Drugs)  Pursuers: Commercial businesses backed by either venture capital and/or space agencies.   3-D printing artificial organs would be a boon to those on the donor organs wait-list. ISS astronauts are also working on this technology to if these artificial organs can withstand the space environment.   Existing Players     Semiconductors and Electronics            Space Forge have spokent about 3D   printing semiconductors and generally manufacturing advanced materials; at   an even I attended, they spoke about how microgravity allows new alloys   to be made that don’t separate due to a lack of gravity.

At the October 2024 talk  at IOP, I think it was Andrew Bacon who spewed some statistics of sample return being unchanged since the Shuttle era. It was $£40,000/kg$ (USD) in the Shuttle era and is currently $£45,000/kg$ (USD) for the SpaceX Dragon 2. I presume this is in 2024 currency as this was said in dialogue.            Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) are a technical gap that Astroscale mentioned at the same October 2024 talk.       Project Blurb (for Inspiration Only)  There is a rapidly growing number of man-made satellites in Earth’s orbit, fulfilling a wide range of tasks. As satellite technology develops, there is a growing interest in the design of satellites such as the International Space Station (ISS), that are capable of sustaining human occupation for extended periods. The design requirements of these occupied satellite systems are complex and depend upon the number of occupants, the expected duration of occupation (i.e. the number of years an astronaut would spend on the satellite) and the overarching purpose of the space station.   Each group will examine a different type of space station, which serves different purposes, including     A habitat for long-term occupation   One with the optical telescopes or other imagers for disaster-monitoring, persistent Earth observations, or space-based astronomy   In-space factory for production of semi-conductors   Students will focus on a single application from the above list and will consider different levels of human occupants, range from less than 10 to several thousand people. The specific objectives include determining precise system-level requirements, estimating costs associated with different possible designs, and developing an Attitude and Orbit Control System. Students will need to survey available launch vehicles (incl. SpaceX’s Starship Super Heavy) to develop cost estimates and a mission plan/architecture for the assembly. The latter will involve developing a high-level concept of operations needed to assemble the desired space station using either robots or astronauts. Again, a trade-off analysis is necessary as a precursor that estimates cost, speed, time, risks, etc. for each assembly style. By the end of the project, students will be expected to conclude with a recommendation on the station design, the chosen assembly architecture in the ConOps (aka Concept of Operations) for their given occupancy limit, and orbit/attitude control system simulations.   Weekly Workshop Philosophy  In line with the formal assessments (listed below) but also to prepare you as future leaders in engineering, our weekly 2-hour workshops are geared primarily towards getting you to developing broader skills than university might typically prepare you for in the early years. Some examples of skills you will develop over the coming weeks are listed below (but this is by no means an exhaustive list):     Public Speaking: elevator pitch style in the early weeks to eventually being able to give rapid updates in the later weeks.   Writing: Developing writing skills.   Insight Generation: Reflecting on technologies1 and the underlying philosophy for their development.   Informal Assessments  Thus, we have the following two informal assessments:     Weekly in-class presentations by each member of every group the entire academic year.   6-page technical report to be submitted in Week 6 of Semester B.

Tools for Writing and Research Managemenent:     \\(\\LaTeX\\) template on Overleaf that I have posted.   Zotero is an excellent and free tool for collecting all the papers you use for your research. These will be used as citations in the Reference section of your report(s). For these reasons, tools like Zotero are also called reference management tools. Worth downloading and reading/wathcing some tutorials online.   Google Scholar is superb for finding scholarly papers in addition to  the resources provided on QM+. A browser plugin can also be installed via Zotero that connects to Google Scholar to quickly import papers that you find interesting; link here for Zotero Connector.   Inkscape is one example of a useful tool for making high quality images. Keynote and PowerPoint are also useful tools not only for making presentations but also for quickly making schematics or editing images.   Some Technical References:     Space Systems Engineering Textbooks. The bible for this is typically SMAD by James Wertz Some goods one are by Stark and Fortescue which is also made available via the Internet Archive. Another is by Fortescue et al. which QMUL students can access on QM+.   If you want to look into how books such as above can inform the development of large space structures, you can read my paper on how to robotically assemble 25 metre space telescopes and another CalTech/NASA-JPL paper on 80 metre telescopes.   My blogposts on:            Comparing wheel space stations to the ISS       Inflatable von Braun stations           A LOT of textbooks that I have collected in many areas (not just space) that you can use for your reports is available here.   Footnotes                 Here, I do not just mean space technolgoies but even those that you use in preparing your reports such as GitHub and \\(\\LaTeX\\). &#8617;           ","categories": [],

Our purpose  The idea is to encourage intuition-driven modelling and computational thinking in three-dimensions. Where most introductory textbooks on classical mechanics emphasise hand-derived models to study motions of simple systems (particles or a simple pendulum), our approach focuses on enabling deeper capabilities with computing. We teach the fundamentals of modeling motion in three dimensions of particles and rigid bodies. We then introduce planar kinematics of rigid multibody systems. Why? Multibody systems are everywhere; humans are one example and robot arms are another. Waiting to introduce students to these concepts in an advanced postgraduate course does little to stimulate imagination, in my humble opinion, or challenge the student. Empowering students with the tools to build models seems like a better way to go about things from both a perspective of upskilling but also for students to find and refine their personal interests in pursuing their educational path into engineering. The use of computational tools early in their career likely I believe this will hold even in the age of AI.  also prepares them  for their future roles in research, industry, and entrepreneurship.   Later courses can build on the modeling capabilities towards analysing systems through numerical simulation in a more discipline specific sense.

        "title": "Howler",
        "excerpt":"AIGrant  Pitch    Demo    YCombinator    The below is my proposal to Emergent Ventures 4 AI submitted in June 2022The proposal was not successful and reading it now, I can see why. But I think the app I built is still pretty cool, even if it is no longer on the App Store . I also pitched Howler to AIGrant and YCombinator; demos and videos of it are below and my submission to Emergent Venures is after.   Emergent Ventures 4 AI: Grant Proposal  Hi, I’m Angadh   In June 2017, after ~10 months as a Visiting Researcher at NASA JPL, I was trying to convince a JPL Chief Technologist of deserving a permanent role as a freshly minted aerospace engineering PhD with relevant work experience. Just like in ~50 similar meetings, I was asked about my nationality which was followed by their template response of International Traffic in Arms Regulations constraining JPL from hiring folks like me without American passports or green cards. On this occasion, I was also asked how I was making rent and feeding myself in Los Angeles with a $10,000 fellowship. Unprepared for that question, tears quickly welled up- I excused myself and ran to the nearest bathroom stall to compose myself. As an upper caste Indian male who has lived more than half his life abroad1, this incident taught me the relative limits of privilege.   A couple months later, I moved to the UK where I have since been working on the problem that I wish to solve: how to simultaneously improve access to information, expertise, and opportunities to provide a pedestal to privilege for those without (relative to me and globally). Today, this work is facilitated by my extant privilege as an engineering academic with a permanent contract and skills as an autodidact programmer.   My solution to the aforementioned problem is to build systems that:     enable others to develop expertise via access to relevant information and/or resources; and   allow my team to present our knowledge/creation to interested parties, some of whom might support our work.   Two systems that I am working on are called:          Space HQ: my academic research lab within Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), where our current mission is to develop next-generation intelligent space robots to realise our vision to commercially build and operate hundred-person orbiting space stations in Low Earth Orbit (~12x of ISS’s occupancy). Our current focus is on developing cloud-based space robotics teaching and research resources accessible to anyone. Currently, these are primarily used in teaching undergraduate computational spacecraft engineering courses in my courses at QMUL; and research in my group in using computational tools to develop robotics technologies for in-space assembly of space structures. One might imagine that such space robotics education resource can be monetized into a certificate program, while allowing Space HQ to retain some graduates to work on the core objecive of larger scale space habitation. Additionally, providing a matchmaking marketplace for Space HQ grads and employers (similar to that seen in Indian universities) can offer another means of generating revenue.            Howler®: is an idea for a non-toxic social media, discussed in the Idea section.       How these solutions help? Invariably, I envision both systems evolving into startups that are engines for generating employment opportunities that have the knock-on effect of re-distributing (or, maybe, disrupting?) privilege. For example, registering Space HQ Ltd as a UK PLC has facilitated engagement with the UK’s space innovation network (e.g., Satellite Applications Catapult. As the space industry operates different to software in many aspects, networking is critical for early stage startups; we are now part of the UK’s Space Energy Initiative that aims to deliver Space Based Solar Power, which requires robotic in-space assembly technologies that Space HQ will develop. Securing a contract from this partnership will enable my research group members to continue onto Space HQ Ltd. I am hoping (and quietly confident) that working on these two efforts will compound to bear a net positive impact on society in terms of opportunities created.   I agree western university education is a poor value-proposition.  I have come to agree with this by contrasting my time in Western academia (PhD in California and a permanent academic position in London) to my undergraduate experience in Bangalore. Indian universities operate as a marketplace for employers and jobseekers by inviting companies for on-campus recruitment in the final year. Western universities operate like a prestigious newspaper selling you a subscription to one paper (degree certificate). A more comical comparison might be that these universities sell a ticket at a platform where trains no longer stop and there is no destination.   Idea   In the Harry Potter universe, Howlers were owl-delivered letters read aloud to recipients in senders’ voices. My eponymous idea, Howler®, builds on this; in-app personal voice messages are quickly converted into podcasts that sound like a synchronous conversation (listen to exemplar Howlcast). Howler’s vision is to democratise podcasting while providing non-toxic content. I am requesting support from Emergent Ventures AI to continue building Howler.   Novelty          Consensus-based publication model: Consider current social media; Facebook and Instagram users tag others in posts, typically without consent. Twitter power users publish posts as individuals which are not assessed prior to publication. These examples of non-consensus social media incentivise individual actions, leading to polarising toxic content. Contrast these to another socially produced media where multi-author publications are more common than solo ones: academic papers. Consent between authors followed by objective review moderates content pre-publication; civil, non-violent communication is the bedrock for achieving publication. Howler embraces a similar model.            AI-augmented moderation: After this consensus step, incorporating an AI-layer to evaluate content pre-publication would support realising a non-toxic social media. At the scale of a global internet, relying on human moderation alone is unrealistic; humans will, of course, continue to provide feedback. Simultaneously, AI-based mechanisms for verification will need to be developed for fake/spam account detection. We believe rapid progress in AI techniques supporting Natural Language Programming technologies (e.g., sentiment analysis of speech and/or voice-to-text for hate speech detection, speaker diarization) will become indispensable in future social media content moderation. This stack will also benefit our users by: aiding podcasters to auto-generate transcripts with speaker identity; and allowing text-based consumption of content by people with hearing disabilities and in noisy environments.            Publication from inbox: When one considers the volumes of potential content in inboxes that go unpublished (which could be kernels for proposals, blogs, etc.), such easy publication from one’s inbox is another valuable novelty.            Flexible creativity: Asynchronous podcast creation enables location and temporal flexibility for hosts and guests that should result in more thoughtful questions and responses.       Progress  My achievements from solely driving Howler over ~14 months:     iOS Prototype on App Store: Single-handedly designed, built, and launched the iOS prototype in April 2022 with no prior experience in app development.   Accelerator shortlisting: Howler is currently shortlisted for Digital Catapult’s flagship accelerator program (Machine Intelligence Garage) to secure $100k of cloud computing resources for AI/ML developments. Interview date: 1st July 2022.   Initial User Acquisition: &gt;70 users recruited (family and friends providing regular feedback to improve the app), some of whom have previously worked in radio and are helping with podcast creation. The next phase will involve acquiring:            Comedy podcasters: As a budding standup comic, I have connections to others with popular podcasts; I will approach them to test/create on Howler.       Amateur and professional podcasting community: Grow amateur user-base within my university (students, staff, and academics). Request two early Howler users working in radio (a BBC podcaster; and a former KQED employee) to help spread the word in the professional podcasting community.       Voice message users: A large community globally and particularly in developing economies. People with disabilities; one nearly blind user believes Howler is a stronger alternative to WhatsApp-style voice messaging.           How EV helps  Howlerʼs main early stage challenge is reaching ”ramen profitability” which is why I have, so far, built it myself (often working full-time, alongside my full-time academic post). Emeregent Venures’ recognition alongside $250K cash support will help Howler:     recruit Mughees and John to drive Android and AI developments, respectively ($150k shared between three of us);   purchase $100k of Google Cloud Platform credits to develop/test AI content moderation;   gain visibility, ideally through use in producing Tyler’s and Shruti’s podcasts.   Howler will then be in a strong position to pitch investors for further investment and connect to a strong talent pool to scale our team (with Tyler’s expertise and network, if possible)   Footnotes                  I am especially privileged from an Indian context with 19 mostlycomfortable years abroad (UK: 5, America: 8, and Nigeria: 6). &#8617;           ","categories": ["Social Media","Grants"],

        "title": "Moravec's Paradox",
        "excerpt":"Over lunch, I watched Chelsea Finn discuss Moravec’s Paradox with people across age and skills groups from kids to expert researchers. It is the idea that humans think any task easy for humans is hard for robots and things that appear hard for humans are easy for robots. For example, physical tasks like stacking plates and folding laundry are easier for humans than robots but multiplying large numbers is harder for usThe funny thing is that I am writing this within Cursor, which automatically chucked in the sentence “Human intelligence is the ability to do things that are hard to do, and artificial intelligence is the ability to do things that are easy to do.” as a sidenote. I think it is a good way to think about the difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence but it is hard to repeatedly do easy things. . It is something I had noted when we saw Lee Sedol beaten by AlphaGo- where was the robot that actually moved the pieces?   Overall, I thought the video was very engaging but I found a couple of points to be noteworthyHence, the note😜. . Chelsea told Stanford researcher, Jennifer Grannen, that a new class of “learned simulators” should be built that use only real world data to recreate physics; this is, of course, something that caught my eye as a dynamicist working on simulations based on first-principles physics. I can see the point she is trying to make as we have seen a bunch of benefits of using data in developing large language models but I am also generally a bit skeptical of the idea that we use data for everything when sensors are inherently noisy- if all we care about is outputs then this is fine but separating process (or signal) from noise is a deeper thing that I think we will lose. Perhaps I am also old-fashioned but the idea of forfeiting our ability to develop abstractions (based on human measurement-free sensors and observations) to computers is also a bit scaryNot in a way that I fear about the role of humans but that it will lead to a loss of taste and will eventually kill creativity .   The other thing I loved was Michael Frank describing his work on computationally modeling babies’ cognition to answer the question “How do babies become human?”. I also appreciated his notion that senses (e.g., vision and sound) are a low-level capability compared to the high-level tasks (eg deliberation), which is mediated by memory and language. As I write this along with AI-suggested sentences, it makes me wonder that even if AI-suggested sentences are human-like, they are genuinely far from being personalised to me. Because there is a black box between my mind/brain and my hands and another one between my hands and the notebook or computer. On that note, I will end with a fun little segue that just came to my mind as I wrote that last sentence: here is Neal Stephenson talking to Lex Fridman about writing by hand being superior to typing on a computer as there is a slower output that keeps up with his cognitive speed. And the thing I have noticed that it is hard to turn off the editor within me when I should merely be focused on writing.

        "title": "Graeber and Thiel",
        "excerpt":"This is a summary towards a longer form essay that will eventually go into “Longer Form” writing   My friends are big fans of David Graeber’s Bullshit Jobs and Debt. Having been more a listener of his, I find his candor amusing and cutting. So when I happened upon him and Peter Thiel talking, I wasn’t going to miss it despite knowing little  about what it was actually onTurns out this is from the book launch of Zero to One. . Going into it, I anticipated an alignment in their values - moreso than one might think purely because the comparably less famous Graeber is anarchist and Thiel is libertarian; this is why I think of this as a conversation rather than a debate.  I suspected their alignment given my own sensibilities that anarchists and early stage  startup foundersIt’s also why I, despite formally being a space engineer, was inspired to build Howler and kept at it while listening to Chomsky’s optimistic views on small decentralised media in Manufacturing Consent.  have a lot in common, in the mold of Aaron Swartz or early-SpaceX Elon Musk.   Overcoming stagnation: working outside or within systems?  While they agreed over the fundamental issue that we live in a world of technological and creative stagnation and the need for actions, they differed over methods of action. Thiel’s perspectives often circle back to a technological lens, where he can champion the solutions in Zero to One: working in small coordinated but non-democratic teams which are well outside systems/institutions. In contrast, Graeber’s is to work in small groups that are democratic and decentralized based on his experience within anarchist groups.   As a technologist, I initially agreed with Thiel’s position and was also unsure of Graeber’s approach. But as Thiel explained his uncertainty, citing anecdotal evidence that democratic startups eventually fall apart where hierarchical oneswhich I think he is careful to not call dictatorial.  thrive, I tended to disagree with Thiel. In my experience, founder-led startups will mostly begin with engineers and the average one tends to skew towards being less concerned about social and political issues which are, in my opinion, actually responsible for the systems we see today that they are working against. If we were more concerned with developing solutions of scale and breadth that require directors, and not dictators, I can see the logic in Graeber’s view. His solution is for groups to embrace a rotating policy that eschews permanent leadership structures. Of course, Graeber’s not interested in pursuit of power or profits but in creating an egalitarian world1.   Further, Graeber argues that monopolies like Apple, Google and Facebook operate in competitive markets and largely stifle innovation because systematic profits aren’t achieved through production of goods/services but through rent extraction; an example is Apple using the App Store to extract “rent” from developers that prevents new monopolies from emerging. What is making this rent  extraction possible? Well, one is likely the abolition of regulated monopolies  (think Bell Labs) but the other thing we lost with that is the higher corporate taxHe unpacks this beautifully in another video- high corporate taxes in the Bell Labs-era counterintuitively drove innovation because 60% corporate tax incentivized investing pre-tax profits into higher staff salaries alongside R&amp;D spending, which was written off. This way the taxes never made it to the government but also didn’t line the pockets of corporations but drove overall productivity. . Today’s corporate tax rates are lower so companies invest profits in financial  activities and engage in rent extracting predatory activities and drive  up debt. This, to a layman economist like me, seems like a better explanation of why lower corporate taxes explain the drop in productivity and why we aren’t reindustrializing - hence the technological stagnation.   The more interesting thing that results from this is that monopolies that emerge from Thiel’s start-up viewpoint are eventually entrenched in the system in many ways. While many general examples are given, I think the most pertinent is when Thiel is questioned about Palantir working with the CIA. This underscores Graeber’s point that one eventually ends up working within the system- whether one changes it or becomes a part of it is a different matter altogether.   From Monopolies to Money  I think the refreshing thing for me (unless I misunderstood) is that Graeber agrees with Thiel that monopolies can be good but only as long as they aren’t rent extracting. Bureaucratic monopolies have proven to be effective in achieving great things quickly, like Apollo and the Manhattan project, under the right conditions. Corporate monopolies, like Bell Labs, demonstrate that acceleration can happen through productive innovation whereas current monopolies, like financial institutions, create a culture of stagnation through - to use a Graeberism- “a direct assault on the human imagination”. Aside from the corporate taxes that incentivise rent seeking behaviours, social welfare economic policies (such as universal basic income) could also overcome the grander creative stagnation evident today.   Money isn't just measuring the value of stuff. It's also measuring the value of human actions and it's also a promise of future creativity. David Graeber Graeber evidences how the UK’s social welfare policies unleashed creativity in the 60s, a period that coincided with the emergence of new bands, like the Beatles, and musical trends every few years. But today’s conditional welfare policies, which he says are from the Blair era, hinder discovering today’s Beatles.   Now John Lennon is like lifting boxes in some department store's welfare conditionality so we are never gonna hear the new the new trend. David Graeber  Competition and Debt Kill Eccentrics  Though we are in the company of the leading contrarians of our time, they are in short supply. The public, like my mom, still think that academia is a home for eccentric thinkers but that is no longer the case which Graeber and Thiel remind us:  Almost any functional society, almost any society which has ever existed, has something which they do with brilliant, imaginative, but extremely impractical people. We don't know what to do with them anymore. They’re all living in their mothers’ basements saying weird things on the internet, and you can’t tell which are crazy and which actually have something to contribute. You used to put them in academia, but now academia is all about self-marketing. Being in academia, I can see very easily what’s happened in my own discipline where any kind of new thinking is really discouraged. David Graeber  The eccentric university professor is a species that is going extinct fast. Peter Thiel  Today, academics are competing for resources by writing grants in an endless cycle. This aligns perfectly with Thiel’s general thesis that competition kills innovation. But the role of debt in promoting stagnation is also a key point, which Graeber  reminds us by citing the UK’s introduction of student loans that successfully made university education less about exploration and more about getting a job. I find Graeber’s position more far-ranging than Thiel’s- his commentary  captures the Thielian view of competition but also of debt promoting stagnation. The matter of debt is perhaps less concerning to the billionaire elite. But Graeber is also more tuned to the need of individual players that aren’t all billionaires or close to Silicon Valley, where networks can promote the eccentrics. How do we help these individuals flourish? As a non-billionaire academic who has tried to start a startup or two, it was hard not to side  with Graeber that working on projects on the side within existing structures even if the pace is glacial by comparison. For the idea is not to work only for personal liberation but for something greater. And we need to think beyond technology too- we need if we are to unearth the next Beatles.   For those interested in the conversation, here’s a link to the talk:     Footnotes                  To some extent answers an internal question I have of why academics, despite being individualist, are motivated to work in groups or departments because they believe in egalitarianismWhich might explain why Graeber’s collectivist philosophy resulted in not making tenure at Yale. Absurd! . But I will contrast again that academia attracts too many early stage researchers without a rudder in early stages. And worse, makes those who have a rudder lose it over time. And this is where startup-style systems differ - the existence of rewards are clear in terms of both power and profit even if it is without purpose. &#8617;           ","categories": ["Innovation","Creativity","Stagnation"],

I have been trying to think about how spacecraft might dock to such a station and how crew might transfer from one vehicle to the other. While I don’t have an answer yet, I thought I would share some videos I watched to ignite my mind. I found the following one by Destin Sandlin to be a nice intro to rendezvousing with the ISS:    The below video is a quick video showing the Space Shuttle (Atlantis) docking to the International Space Station.     The video below is similar to the one by Destin Sandlin in that it gives some insight into the orbital mechanics. However, it gives a lot more insight into Soyuz-related launch from Baikonur and its high-level structural design (I just decided to toss in the Soyuz image from the video).  Soyuz structure.  The voice of the narrator is a bit annoying, though.    Obviously, the above videos are not directly related to inflatable space stations but they do give some perspective on how docking is affected by structural aspects of the spacecraft (e.g., we see how the Shuttle is different from the Soyuz) and the station.

        "excerpt":"In an earlier post, I linked to Jared Owen’s excellent video on space stations and that I would follow up with a summary of his chapter on docking ports.   ⊕ The ISS has two segments.   ⊕ PMA-1 connects the Russian and American segments whereas PMA-2 and PMA-3 are used for docking with the Shuttle and the Crew Dragon.   Now, the ISS can be considered to be made of two segments (see image on right margin)- a Russian and an American one- that are connected to each other by an adapter, called the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA). There are actually three PMAs and PMA-1 is the one that connects the two segments (again, see image on right margin). The reason it is called an adapter is because, much like an electrical adapter, it has two different connectors on each side. On the one side is the American standard of a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) and on the other side is the Russian standard of an Automated Proximity and Approach System (APAS):   PMA1 has a CBM on one side and an APAS on the other.  ⊕ The CBM connects modules from Japan and Europe to the American segment.   The CBM is used to connect modules from Japan and Europe to the American segment (see image on right margin). The two other PMAs are also on the American segment; they previously allowed the Shuttle to dock to the ISS. Since its retirement, PMA2’s got another adapter- called the International Docking Adapter (IDA)- to allow the Crew Dragon to dock to the ISS.   ⊕ The IDA is used to connect the Crew Dragon to the ISS.   To learn more about the early part of the ISS’s assembly, Jared Owen’s video is highly recommended! Hope he completes the rest of the ISS assembly sequence in a future video.

        "title": "Some notes on BEAM",
        "excerpt":"Rajib Dasgupta’s 2016 interview as NASA BEAM (Bigelow Expandable Activity Module) project manager is quite informative for those interested in inflatable space  habitats. BEAM’s addition to the ISS jas proved that expandable tech on a human-rated spacecraft (ISS) can reach TRL 9.   Mission profile and inflation process  BEAM was added to ISS shortly after in April 2016 as an addition to the Tranquility module, delivered on a Dragon capsule launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 what a legacy! . A good example of in-orbit assembly, the mission profile involves the the Canadarm2, which extracts BEAM from the Dragon’s unpressurised trunk 5 days after. The arm is also used in berthing Dragon, after its two day journey to the ISS, to Node 2’s nadir berthing port of the ISS. Then the arm is moved via its Mobile Transporter cart (at least that’s how I understood Rajib) and BEAM is berthed to the Node-3 aft port. The below image of the ISS shows these directions and others.   ISS directional sense (courtesy: Jared Owen&#8217;s ISS video).  Then, the module can be deployed and inflated. The inflation process plays out in the following way: the first part is to pressurise the vestibule, which is the  section/region that connects BEAM and Node 3. Then, the vestibule is prepared for  deployment by setting up the deployment controller and making the necesary  electrical connections. Then, the crew can begins expanding the BEAM module first by using ISS air, via the MPEV valve, to get it to its full shape at a pressure of 0.4 PSI. Once that is done, the crew releases air in the 8 inflation tanks attached to BEAM using the aforementioned deployment controller- this increases pressure from 0.4 PSI to atmospheric pressure of 14.7 PSI (to equalise it with the ISS’s pressure). Then testing begins with an 80-hour leak check followed by crew entering the module to prepare the vestibule ducting to start air flow inside the module. This is followed by first “ingress” to the module to collect an air sample for safety and quality checks. By this time, it’s almost a month (maybe two) since launch.   Technology Objectives  The objectives for BEAM were to:     study its long-term leak performance and air quality;   assess the radiation environment inside the module compared to the rest of the ISS’s metallic modules (REM and RAM passive badges sensors);   deployment dynamic sensor to study the dynamic loads generated during deployment;   Distributed Impact Detection System (DIDS) is a sensor to measure the impact of MMOD on the outer surface of the module; and   sensors to measure the thermal conditions and air quality in the module.   A lot of data was envisioned to be collected over two years aligned to these objectives. After that, the plan was to jettison beam using Canadarm: it grapples BEAM using the aft side power data and grapple fixtures and transfers BEAM to the extreme nadir position of the ISS for release. Their estimated time for jettison and uncontrolled re-entry is “less than a year”. Fortunately, BEAM has exceeded expectations and is still in use in 2024 as additional cargo.

        "title": "Varoufakis' and Graeber's critique and visions of progress offer no solutions",
        "excerpt":"These were some quick thoughts I shared with a friend after reading Varoufakis’ recent article on a Star Trek-inspired Utopia. This loosely links to my earlier post on “Graeber and Thiel”.   Yanis’ utopian view is one I agree with that we should aim to live in a future  where “People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things.” But his  reasoning that accumulation is followed by imperialism is weak. Why? Becuase his  premise is that a post-scarcity utopia can be achieved through energy abundance (which is really what Star Trek’s “Replicators” are: machines that can make  anything from green energyI haven’t watched Star Trek so I am using his description of them. ). The follow-on question, which he doesn’t really address, is how can one get to this  infinite energy future without a manufacturer of solar panels or some other harnessing technology of permanent/renewable energy sources? Can we manufacture anything without gathering (accumulating!) resources to manufacture these  technologies capable of harnessing and then supplying this infinite energy?   Just because energy is itself freely available doesn’t mean that we can manufacture  distribution technologies without resource accumulation, which inevitably requires  capital and agency. Today, capital is a basis for enabling agency to create these energy abundance technologies just as much as good will/intentions. This capital can come from bureaucractic governments, which are slow, or private capital, which can  be fast- both can be to a detrimentWhich is why we need to seriously experiment with new ways to organise action. . Thus, I don’t see  anyway out of accumulation. In fact, I see it as essential to our energy abundant  future- a future where energy is too cheap to meter.The questions that then follow  are what are our technology optionswhich I will explore in a future post.  to achieve this abundance and then we can think  about the politics of organised action.   Capital is new; the evolution of our trading behaviours are not. Varoufakis’ position ignores our roots as not just hunters, but gatherers, which enables trade/barter (i.e., much like I said about capital enabling agency but also many other things). To me, it follow that if no one gathers, then no one can have and therefor no one share/trade/barter with another. In that vein, if everyone gathers (the same stuff) then everyone can have but again, no one need share/trade/barter. But in reality effort and motivation are not equally distributed among a population, which’s why only some people gather some of the stuff which then creates conditions for trading.   Both Graeber (whom I love as his wit reminds me of Christopher Hitchens) and Yanis have lofty goals but do not present concrete  ideas of getting there from where we currently are. And this, to me, is lazy. What we need to do is to solve a motion planning problem that generates a path using, as inputs, today’s conditions and their utopian goal  state. But they don’t do that- perhaps it is because they are incapable of  thinking about things in that way or they disagree with it or purely because they  are more comfortable with arm-chair philosophising, which is frustrating.  Moralistic posturing of this kind without action is hard to get behind because it exposes a lack of appreciation of, especially today, technology being upstream of politics and not the other way around. One only needs to look at the recent use of social  media in elections across the world to understand this claim’s veracity. One can counterargue that Apollo is an example of politics bucking the claim but one only needs to look at the idea’s origin: Tsiolkovsky articulated the need for liquid propelants, which inspired research into rocket propulsion (largely in Germany and America) that was then weaponised and eventually became the basis for the Apollo programWorth reading the first chapter of John Drury Clark’s Ignition. . The political choices of weaponisation and space exploration was thus downstream of rocket technology progress.   So, reader, I leave you with questions: do we really need another critique on  today’s world without a semblance of a solution? How long can we run on the fumes  of a vision of what a wonderful world it could be?  ","categories": ["Innovation","Creativity","Stagnation"],

        "excerpt":"These are some notes on the paper “Free-floating space manipulator impacting a floating object: Modeling and output SDRE controller design” by Nekoo et al.   Abstract  This work investigates the dynamics modeling, control, and impact resolution between a floating object and a free-floating space manipulator (FFSM). The controller design is carried out by using an output- and state-dependent Riccati equation (OSDRE) approach. In a collision between an object and a mechanism, the computation of the generalized velocities and the impact force or impulse, which are interrelated, is a challenging problem. Taking into account the free-floating conditions of the space environment, the conservation of linear and angular momentum equations, combined with the conservation of kinetic energy under the elastic impact assumption, are used to find the unknown variables of the impact problem. The control problem addressed for the FFSM is to regulate its end-eﬀector in a point-to-point motion scenario, this while the space manipulator suﬀers an unintended impact with a floating object, such as a damaged satellite or space debris. By proposing a safety pause starting with the occurrence of impact and for a short duration thereafter, the proposed OSDRE design succeeds in achieving the end-eﬀector regulation control. Although the FFSM can reach the target point, it is shown that maintaining the end-eﬀector regulation at the target is not feasible due to the momentum imparted to the FFSM as a result of the collision. To this end, we employ a simple thruster control on the space manipulator base to complete the regulation task. The theoretical development and controller design are demonstrated through a simulation case study of a spacecraft equipped with a three-link manipulator colliding with an object.

        "title": "Some Space Stations in Fiction and Reality",
        "excerpt":"An earlier post in my teaching resources for  a final year undergraduate project had a pretty helpful AI-generatedthanks to Claude  table. This is a quick post about Wernher von Braun’s 1950’s conceptual rotating wheel station with some basic comparisons to the ISS (1998-present) and 1968’s Space Station V from 2001: A Space OdysseyWatch this as homework! .   Von Braun’s Rotating Wheel Space Station  Wernher von Braun’s video envisioned a rotating wheel space station with 9 sections for:     Headquarters and Communications   Earth Weather Observation/Prediction   Military Reconnaissance using Optical and Radar Telescopes   Emergency Hospital Section   Astronomy   Calculation Machines and a lower/outer deck with maintenance facilities   A/C equipment   Living quarters   Botanical and Zoological Laboratory The video shows two decks per section, which I assume is 6 $m$ in heigh (i.e. the habitable portion between the outer rim and inner rim). Wikipedia says the concept had 3 decks but as I haven’t looked that up, I will stick to two 6 $m$ decks for now.   The system is powered by an atomic reactor attached on one side of its central hub; its heat will drive a turbo generator to power the station. Radio and radar antennas sit atop the reactor. The other side of the hub has an airlock for astronauts to access/exit the space station via smaller spacecraft. Like a bicycle wheel, the system had thin spokes are condensers for the turbo generator and air-conditioning plant. Three larger tubes are elevator shafts that connect the hub to the main habitable sections of the wheel station. The station would:     host 50 astronauts though Wikipedia states 80 people.   rotate at roughly 3 rpm to produce artificial gravity on the rim; and   be a torus of 250 $ft$ (76  $m$) diameter. The distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus is $R = 70/2 = 35 \\, m$ and the minor radius of the tube is $r = 6/2 = 3 \\, m$. The volume of this torus is then the station’s total pressurized volume, which is given by \\((V_{tot})_{vB} = 2 {\\pi^2} R {r^2}\\).   So, we can estimate that the von Braun space station has a:     Total Pressurized Volume: = 6217.85 $m^3$   Habitable Volume = 3730.71 $m^3$   Here, I assumed that 60% of the pressurized volume is habitable. This is a considerably more optimistic percentage compared to the 42% of ISS.   How did von Braun imagine its realisation?  ⊕ Assembly of the Modular Rotating Wheel Space Station. ⊕ Condenser pipes being unwound for installation.   The short-version is that he assumed predominantly modular robotic assembly and a minor reliance on inflatables for the airlock. First, the hub is inflated using compressed air from built-in tanks. Protection from meteors is ensured by putting thin metal plates; this is unnecessary today as we have developed high-strength textiles that are used on inflatable space stations. A second launch brings with it an airlock, which is again attached by robots; this allows the pressurized hub to be used as a temporary quarters as the station assembly continues with astronaut-robot teams. Pre-fabricated and tested on the ground after which it is dismantled and assembled robotically in-orbit. A number successive launches (he says) ensure the “parts of the station  are assembled in the correct order”. Nylon tethers prevent parts from drifting away. The reactor appears to be the next big piece that is installed so I assume this is the third launch. This is followed by the elevator shafts and the rim sections being brought together. We can assume a single launch for each module: $3$ elevator tubes and 9 rim modules (assuming one per section). Assuming condenser pipes are installed from one launch (but the structure itself needs to be unwound robotically, which seems unreasonable/unreal at the moment as a robotic task.   Lastly, the installation of instruments/equipment (a simple catch-all term for imaging antennas and the lab facilities compute for astronomical/Earth Observation data analysis, I think) and two small rocket motors on the rim. These rocket motors “blast for a few seconds” to revolve the station at about $3 \\, RPM$.

What could we do today?   Doesn’t really say how many launches are needed to realize assembly in the video. This can probably be found elsewhere but my estimate from watching the video is 15-18 launches.   The process involves a number of assembly robots but we barely have one of these today. And whatever is there not autonomous.   Materials used in assembly are unknown.   Telescope sizes for reconnaisance and astronomy are unknown.   Power requirements are unknown.   What else?
